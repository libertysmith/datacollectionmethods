    "text": "Analyze a Qualtrics Survey Template and Improve it\nThis Movie Rental Behaviors Survey Template is analyzed for the purposes of assessing its internal and external validity. You can take or review the unedited survey here.\n\nHow is the survey structured?\n\n\nWhat is it composed of?\n\n\nHow are they ordered?\nIn this comprehensive survey, we delve into the nuances of movie renting preferences and habits, leveraging the power of data analytics to extract meaningful insights. Our survey comprises a total of 18 crafted Qualtrics questions, each strategically designed to uncover the fascinating layers of consumer behavior.\nThe journey begins with the first question, which unfolds into a captivating narrative with 12 sub-questions, presented with the Likert scale responses. These sub-questions serve as our compass, guiding us through the myriad of choices and preferences that shape the modern movie-watching experience. From preferred movie ratings to rental frequency, we explore it all, giving each response a quantitative weight that illuminates patterns and trends.\nDiving deeper, we encounter binary questions, offering respondents a simple yet impactful choice between “yes” and “no.” These questions serve as data points that punctuate our survey, allowing us to draw clear distinctions and make informed decisions based on dichotomous preferences.\nWe venture into the realm of ordinal and nominal multiple-choice responses, steering away from traditional Likert scales to gather unique insights that go beyond the conventional. These responses are the paintbrush strokes on our canvas, adding color and texture to the rich tapestry of movie-watching habits.\nIn the final leg of our survey, we turn our attention to five demographic questions. These demographic data points - income, gender, marital status, location, and age - are the pillars upon which we build a comprehensive understanding of our respondents. Through these demographic lenses, we paint a vivid portrait of the diverse tapestry of movie enthusiasts.\nIn sum, this survey isn’t merely a collection of questions; it’s an intricate data tapestry. It’s an exploration of preferences, a journey through habits, and a window into the lives of movie aficionados. With data analytics as our compass, we’re prepared to unveil the hidden gems of consumer behavior and gain profound insights into the world of movie renting.\n\n\nWhat can be done to improve the respondants’ experiences?\nI re-created and structured this survey for maximum internal and external validation in a new version that can be taken and reviewed here.\nIn crafting this survey, I re-engineered and thoughtfully structured it with an unwavering focus on the pursuit of internal and external validation as well as minimizing non-responses. Our commitment to this approach stems from a deep understanding of the nuances involved in data analytics, which has led us to take several strategic measures.\nRecognizing that a significant portion of our respondents are likely to engage with this survey on mobile devices, we’ve implemented a design that optimizes user experience. To enhance clarity and mitigate potential respondent fatigue, the formidable Likert scale with its 12 subquestions has been artfully deconstructed into three distinct sections. By doing so, we encourage respondents to engage with these most thought-provoking questions in digestible portions, reducing the likelihood of survey abandonment.\nMoreover, we’ve positioned these questions at the outset of the survey, capturing the respondent’s attention and fostering engagement right from the start. This not only contributes to the overall quality of the data collected but also sets a captivating tone for the survey experience.\nIn an effort to make the survey more user-friendly, we’ve innovatively transformed Likert scale responses into user-friendly drop-down menus (seen below). This user-centric adaptation simplifies the process of answering, enhancing the overall survey experience.\n\n\n\nDrop Down Image\n\n\nTo further streamline respondent engagement, we’ve strategically incorporated force response questions and implemented skip logic. These features serve as invaluable tools in maintaining a minimal non-response rate while ensuring that the survey adapts to the unique preferences and behavior of each user.\n\n\nTHE END"

    "text": "Google Trends Website VS Rstudio’s gtrendsR package\n\nGoogle Trends Website\nGoogle Trends is a web service provided by Google that allows users to explore the popularity of specific search terms over time. It provides valuable insights into how often a particular keyword or topic has been searched for on Google’s search engine. Here’s an explanation of how Google Trends extracts and presents search term trends, including its customization options and main functionalities:\n\n\n\nSearch Terms Trump, Biden, and Election since launch of Google Trends\n\n\nData Collection: Google Trends collects data from Google Search queries. It compiles this data anonymously and aggregates it to create a comprehensive dataset.\nTime Period Customization: Users can customize the time period they want to analyze. Google Trends allows you to specify a custom date range, from a few hours to several years. You can select specific start and end dates, making it easy to focus on a particular timeframe.\nData Normalization: Google Trends normalizes data to allow for fair comparisons. It scales search interest data relative to the total search volume, which ensures that results are not influenced by the overall growth in Google searches over time. This normalization helps users understand relative popularity.\nGeographic Customization: Users can choose the geographic region for which they want to view search trends. Google Trends provides data at various levels, from global to city-specific. This feature is useful for analyzing how search interests vary across different locations.\nCategory Filtering: Google Trends categorizes search topics into specific categories. Users can filter search results by these categories, making it easier to explore trends in specific industries or areas of interest.\nRelated Queries and Topics: Google Trends offers insights into related queries and topics. Users can see which search terms are frequently associated with the topic they are exploring. This feature helps identify related trends and keywords.\nReal-Time Data: Google Trends provides real-time data on search trends. Users can see how the popularity of a search term changes over the course of a day, week, or any specified time interval. This is particularly useful for monitoring breaking news or events.\nData Visualization: The service presents data in easy-to-understand visualizations, including line graphs and charts. Users can quickly grasp the popularity trends of their selected search terms.\nExporting Data: Google Trends allows users to export data for further analysis. You can download CSV files containing search interest data for the terms and timeframes you’ve selected.\nComparative Analysis: Users can compare the search interest of multiple terms simultaneously. This feature helps identify which terms are more popular and how they relate to each other.\nIn summary, Google Trends extracts data from Google Search queries, normalizes it for fair comparisons, and offers a range of customization options. Users can explore search term trends based on different timeframes, locations, categories, and related queries. It also provides real-time data, visualization tools, and the ability to export data for in-depth analysis. Google Trends is a valuable tool for marketers, researchers, and anyone interested in understanding search trends and consumer behavior.\n\n\nRstudio’s gtrendsR package\nWhile both Google Trends website and the gtrendsR package in R allow you to access Google Trends data, there are differences in how you interact with and utilize these methods.\n\n# Load package\nlibrary(gtrendsR)\n# Pull Google Trends Data from \"all time\" interval\nBidenTrumpElection = gtrends(c(\"Trump\",\"Biden\",\"election\"), time = \"all\")\n# Graph identical plot seen in web example\npar(family=\"Georgia\")\nplot(BidenTrumpElection)\n\n\n\n\nThe Google Trends website welcomes users with its intuitive, user-friendly interface, akin to an explorer’s trusted map and compass. Here, one can quickly visualize trends, explore geographic variations, and uncover valuable insights with ease.\nThe ‘gtrendsR’ package has optional arguments for many of the same customizations users can change on the website including but not limited to time, geolocation, and search type that the webpage offers. Both have near identical data querying and toggling settings. While both Google Trends website and the gtrendsR package in R allow you to access Google Trends data, there are differences in how you interact with and utilize these methods. Main differences lie in availability of a user-friendly interface verses a programmic one which enable more visualization and computation methods through base R and other R packages in analyzing the trends.\nOn the other hand, the gtrendsR package in R equips adventurers with a toolkit for programmatic exploration. It’s like having a set of powerful scientific instruments at your disposal. This method empowers users with the ability to harness the full analytical prowess of R and other complementary R packages. Whether you seek to uncover hidden trends, apply advanced statistical methods, or create stunning visualizations, the programmatic nature of this package amplifies your analytical capabilities.\nSee an example below. We will create a heat map through the ggplot2 package to extrapolate on correlations.\n\n# Load ggplot2 package\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n\n# Create new list object specific heat map purposes\nBidenTrumpElection2 &lt;- gtrends(c(\"Trump\", \"Biden\", \"election\"), \n                               time = \"today+5-y\", \n                               geo = (\"US\"))\n\n# Convert \"date\" column to POSIXct format\nBidenTrumpElection2$interest_over_time$date &lt;- as.POSIXct(BidenTrumpElection2$interest_over_time$date)\n\n# Replace \"&lt;1\" with 0 in the \"hits\" column\nBidenTrumpElection2$interest_over_time$hits[BidenTrumpElection2$interest_over_time$hits == \"&lt;1\"] &lt;- 0\n\n# Convert \"hits\" to continuous\nBidenTrumpElection2$interest_over_time$hits &lt;- as.numeric(BidenTrumpElection2$interest_over_time$hits)\n\n# Create the heatmap\nheatmap_plot &lt;- ggplot(data = BidenTrumpElection2$interest_over_time, aes(x = date, y = keyword, fill = hits)) +\n  geom_tile() +\n  scale_fill_gradient(low = \"blue\", high = \"red\") +\n  labs(title = \"Google Trends Heatmap\", x = \"Date\", y = \"Keyword\") +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n# Print the heatmap\nprint(heatmap_plot)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTHE END"
